# 4.4
When an equation is in the form Ax+By=C, we say it is in standard form.
Determine which ordered pairs are solutions to the equation x+4y=8.
- ⓐ  (0,2)
    - 0 + 4(2) = 8
        - 8 = 8
- ⓑ  (2,−4)
    - 2 + 4(-4) = 8
        - 2 - 16 = 8
            - 14 != 8
- ⓒ  (−4,3)
    - -4 + 4(3) = 8
        - -4 + 12 = 8
            - 8 = 8

# 4.5
Which of the following ordered pairs are solutions to the equation y=5x−1?
- ⓐ  (0,−1)
    - -1 = 5(0)-1
        - -1 = -1
- ⓑ  (1,4)
    - 4 = 5(1)-1
        - 4 = 4
- ⓒ  (−2,−7)
    - -7 = 5(-2)-1
        - -7 = -10 -1
            - -7 != -11
